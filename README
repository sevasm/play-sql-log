Play application to illustrate lack of SQL query logging when using JNDI / JPA in Play 2.5.3
=================================

No additional configuration needed to run

Access application by navigating to http://localhost:9000 after application is started

Select whether JDBC or JPA should be used to execute queries

Next page will show a list of users in the in-memory H2 database

Add users by entering a username and clicking Submit

Note that SQL being executed is only logged to console and logs/application.log when using JDBC and not when using JPA
